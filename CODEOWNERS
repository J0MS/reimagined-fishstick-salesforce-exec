# CODEOWNERS file automatically adds listed users as reviews and code owners to respective directories
# The backend works bottom-up, so from the end of the file to the beginning the first directory condition that is satisfied will be evaluated
# In the future, it may make sense to create User Groups but we can hard-code Git Hub usernames for now

# Base reviewers (if no directory specified, this will run) (* is wildcard)
*  @J0MS

# directory syntax (just as an example, can delete if you don't want this in the Repo)
# /observability/packages/ @megelonabi

# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
# *       @global-owner1 @global-owner2

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
# *.js    @js-owner

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.
# *.go docs@example.com

# Teams can be specified as code owners as well. Teams should
# be identified in the format @org/team-name. Teams must have
# explicit write access to the repository. In this example,
# the octocats team in the octo-org organization owns all .txt files.
#  *.txt @octo-org/octocats

# In this example, @doctocat owns any files in the build/logs
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
# /build/logs/ @doctocat

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
#  docs/*  docs@example.com

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository.
#  apps/ @octocat

# In this example, @doctocat owns any file in the `/docs`
# directory in the root of your repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
# /docs/ @doctocat

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in the `/apps` 
# directory in the root of your repository except for the `/apps/github` 
# subdirectory, as its owners are left empty.
# /apps/ @octocat
# /apps/github
